1.要求：Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. 
    But, you should give each child at most one cookie. 
    Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with;  
    and each cookie j has a size sj. 
    If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. 
    Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
